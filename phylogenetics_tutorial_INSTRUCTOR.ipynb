    "✓ Data loaded successfully!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 👩‍🏫 Teaching Tips\n",
    "- **Dataset choice**: Cytochrome b is ideal because:\n",
    "  - Well-studied gene (students can verify results)\n",
    "  - Moderate evolutionary rate (not too conserved, not too variable)\n",
    "  - Clear taxonomic relationships (primates vs rodents vs cetaceans)\n",
    "- **Equal lengths**: These are already aligned - we'll realign to demonstrate MAFFT\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧬 Biological Context\n",
    "- **Cytochrome b**: Mitochondrial gene encoding part of respiratory chain\n",
    "- **Why mitochondrial?**: \n",
    "  - Maternal inheritance (no recombination)\n",
    "  - Fast mutation rate (good for recent evolution)\n",
    "  - Easy to sequence\n",
    "- **Expected relationships**: \n",
    "  - Primates cluster (Human, Chimp, Gorilla)\n",
    "  - Rodents cluster (Mouse, Rat)\n",
    "  - Whale as outgroup (most distant)\n",

    "- Understand purpose of multiple sequence alignment\n",

    "- Some variable regions (conservation <50%)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 👩‍🏫 Teaching Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept - What is Alignment?**\n",
    "- Analogy: Like aligning text in columns so we can compare letter-by-letter\n",
    "- Purpose: Identify homologous positions (same evolutionary origin)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Conservation:**\n",
    "- High conservation = important for function (purifying selection)\n",
    "- Low conservation = less constrained (neutral or positive selection)\n",
    "- Cytochrome b shows moderate conservation (typical for protein-coding genes)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚠️ Common Misconceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Misconception**: \"100% conservation means sequences are identical\"  \n",
    "**Reality**: Conservation is position-by-position. High mean conservation with variable regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Misconception**: \"Alignment creates similarity\"  \n",
    "**Reality**: Alignment reveals existing similarity. MAFFT doesn't change sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Misconception**: \"Identity to consensus = similarity between all sequences\"  \n",
    "**Reality**: Consensus is theoretical; actual pairwise similarities vary.\n",

    "#### 💡 Discussion Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Why do we align before building trees?\"**\n",
    "   - Need to compare homologous positions\n",
    "   - Insertions/deletions complicate direct comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"What does the conservation plot tell us?\"**\n",
    "   - Most of cytochrome b is conserved (functional constraint)\n",
    "   - Variable regions provide phylogenetic signal\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"How would this plot look for a more conserved gene (like rRNA)?\"**\n",
    "   - Higher overall conservation\n",
    "   - Fewer variable regions\n",
    "   - Less phylogenetic resolution for recent divergences\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎓 Advanced Points (if time permits)\n",

    "- Trade-offs between speed and accuracy\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **HKY/GTR**: Substitution model (GTR is most complex)\n",
    "- **+F**: Unequal base frequencies (empirical frequencies)\n",
    "- **+G4**: Gamma rate heterogeneity with 4 categories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top Models:**\n",
    "- Model comparison table shows top 5 by BIC\n",
    "- Best models usually differ by small BIC values (<10)\n",
    "- More complex models (GTR) vs simpler (HKY)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 👩‍🏫 Teaching Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explain Model Selection Like This:**\n",
    "\"We're choosing the best mathematical description of how DNA evolves. Too simple = inaccurate. Too complex = overfitting. ModelFinder finds the sweet spot.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Complexity Ladder:**\n",
    "1. **JC69**: Simplest (all changes equally likely)\n",
    "2. **K80**: Transitions ≠ transversions\n",
    "3. **HKY**: K80 + unequal base frequencies\n",
    "4. **GTR**: Most complex (all parameters free)\n",
    "5. **+G**: Add rate variation across sites\n",
    "6. **+I**: Add invariant sites\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why +G4 Usually Wins:**\n",
    "- Real genes have rate variation (conserved vs variable sites)\n",
    "- Gamma distribution models this well\n",
    "- 4 categories is standard (good accuracy/speed trade-off)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚠️ Common Misconceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Misconception**: \"The best model is the 'true' model of evolution\"  \n",
    "**Reality**: All models are wrong, some are useful. We pick the most useful approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Misconception**: \"More complex is always better\"  \n",
    "**Reality**: Overfitting! BIC penalizes complexity. Simpler model preferred if fit is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Misconception**: \"Different models give different trees\"  \n",
    "**Reality**: Model affects branch lengths and support more than topology. Major relationships usually robust.\n",

    "   - Almost always +G4 (rate heterogeneity)\n",
    "   - Rarely +I for this dataset (few truly invariant sites)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"How much better than simpler models?\"**\n",
    "   - Check BIC difference\n",
    "   - Difference >10 = strongly better\n",

    "**Reality**: Bootstrap = frequency of branch appearing in resampled data. Not posterior probability.\n",

    "3. **\"Trees show ancestor-descendant relationships\"** ❌\n",
    "   - Shows common ancestry, not direct descent\n",
    "   - Tips are contemporaries, not ancestor/descendant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrap Interpretation:**\n",

    "   Median: 0.02-0.04\n",
    "   Min: 0.001-0.01 (very recent splits)\n",

    "   Std Dev: 0.03-0.05\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminal Branch Patterns:**\n",
    "- **Shortest**: Human-Chimp (~0.001-0.005) - very recent divergence\n",
    "- **Intermediate**: Gorilla, Mouse, Rat (~0.01-0.03)\n",
    "- **Longest**: Often Whale (~0.05-0.10) - more divergent\n",

    "- 0.01 = 1% of sites differ\n",
    "- 0.10 = 10% of sites differ\n",
    "- Corrected for multiple substitutions (not raw differences)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Branch Lengths Vary:**\n",
    "1. **Time**: More time = more substitutions\n",

    "**Expected Patterns:**\n",
    "- **Short Human-Chimp branch**: Diverged only ~6 million years ago\n",

    "**Misconception**: \"Branch length = time\"  \n",
    "**Reality**: Branch length = substitutions = time × rate. Variable rates mean time ≠ distance.\n",

    "**Misconception**: \"Longer branch = more evolved\"  \n",
    "**Reality**: More substitutions ≠ more \"advanced\". Just more change (possibly neutral).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Format 1: Guided Workshop (90 minutes)**\n",
    "- 10 min: Introduction to phylogenetics\n",
    "- 60 min: Students work through notebook with checkpoints\n",
    "- 20 min: Group discussion of results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format 2: Flipped Classroom (2 sessions)**\n",
    "- Homework: Complete notebook before class\n",
    "- Class 1: Discuss results, address questions\n",
    "- Class 2: Advanced extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format 3: Self-Paced Online**\n",
    "- Students complete independently\n",
    "- Submit interpretation exercises\n",
    "- Office hours for questions\n",

    "\n",
    "Pause at these points for group discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **After alignment (15 min in)**: \n",
    "   - \"What does conservation mean?\"\n",
    "   - Check everyone succeeded\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **After ModelFinder (25 min in)**:\n",
    "   - \"Why does model selection matter?\"\n",
    "   - Discuss model complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **After tree visualization (40 min in)**:\n",
    "   - \"What do you see in the tree?\"\n",
    "   - Practice reading trees together\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **After exercises (60 min in)**:\n",
    "   - Share interpretations\n",
    "   - Compare results\n",

    "### Common Teaching Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge**: Students race ahead without reading  \n",
    "**Solution**: Checkpoints with discussion questions\n",

    "**Challenge**: Wide range of technical skills  \n",
    "**Solution**: Pair programming (technical + biological expertise)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge**: Confusion about tree interpretation  \n",
    "**Solution**: Practice with hand-drawn trees first\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge**: Students don't understand why steps matter  \n",
    "**Solution**: Show what happens if you skip steps (misaligned → wrong tree)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Active Learning Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think-Pair-Share**: \n",
    "- Pose question (\"What's the best model?\")\n",
    "- Think individually (1 min)\n",
    "- Discuss with partner (2 min)\n",
    "- Share with class (3 min)\n",

    "**Predict-Observe-Explain**:\n",
    "- Predict tree topology before running\n",
    "- Observe actual results\n",
    "- Explain matches/mismatches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gallery Walk**:\n",
    "- Students post their trees\n",
    "- Walk around, compare\n",
